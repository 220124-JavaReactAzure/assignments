Spring Challenges:

1. Create a new class with at least 3 attributes and create some using constructor based and setter injection using XML.

2. Use XML configuration to create a bean that has a collection. Put at least 3 items in the collection.
Refer to [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring/spring_injecting_collection.htm) if you get stuck.

3. Use annotations to instantiate a bean from the class created in the first challenge.
